                                    themes, and other relevant components, and dynamically rendering the HTML, CSS, and
                                    JavaScript code that make up the web page. Some Content Delivery Applications may
                                    use server-side rendering (SSR), while others may utilize client-side rendering
                                    (CSR) or a combination of both (e.g., hybrid rendering).

                            Name System): </span><span>It is a distributed (interconnected DNS servers) naming system
                            used to translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
                            <br><br>
                            When you type a domain name, such as "www.example.com", into your web browser, the DNS
                            system is responsible for finding the corresponding IP address associated with that domain.
                            It acts as a directory that matches the domain name to the correct IP address of the server
                            hosting the website or providing the requested service. A domain can have an email address
                            associated with it.
                            <br><br>
                            The DNS system consists of a hierarchy of servers distributed worldwide. These servers
                            work together to resolve domain names into IP addresses. When you enter a domain name, your
                            computer first contacts a local DNS resolver (typically provided by your internet service
                            provider). If the local resolver doesn't have the IP address in its cache, it queries other
                            DNS servers in a recursive manner until it finds the correct IP address. The IP address is
                            then returned to your computer, allowing it to establish a connection with the desired
                            website or service.

                        <br><span>The DNS servers are organized in a hierarchical manner, forming a network of
                            interconnected servers. At the top of the hierarchy are the root DNS servers. These servers
                            store information about the top-level domains (TLDs) such as .com, .org, .net, and the
                            country-code TLDs like .uk, .fr, etc. Beneath the root servers are the authoritative DNS
                            servers responsible for specific domain names or zones.
                            <br><br>
                            When a DNS resolver receives a query for a domain name, it starts by contacting one of the
                            root DNS servers. The root server doesn't have detailed information about the requested
                            domain but can direct the resolver to the appropriate TLD server. The TLD server, in turn,
                            provides the resolver with the address of the authoritative DNS server responsible for the
                            specific domain.
                            <br><br>
                            The authoritative DNS server holds the actual DNS records for the domain, including the IP
                            address associated with the domain name. The resolver can then contact the authoritative DNS
                            server to obtain the IP address and return it to the requesting client.
                            <br><br>
                            Once the client receives the IP address, it can establish a direct connection with the
                            server hosting the desired website or service. The client uses the obtained IP address to
                            send network packets to the server, requesting the specific content or service associated
                            with the domain name.
                            <br><br>
                            The client's operating system or application typically handles the connection establishment
                            process. It opens a network connection to the IP address received and communicates with the
                            server using the appropriate network protocols (such as HTTP for websites). The server, in
                            turn, responds to the client's requests and provides the requested content or service over
                            the established connection.</span>
