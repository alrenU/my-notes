                            Name System): </span><span>It is a distributed (interconnected DNS servers) naming system
                            used to translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
                            <br><br>
                            When you type a domain name, such as "www.example.com", into your web browser, the DNS
                            system is responsible for finding the corresponding IP address associated with that domain.
                            It acts as a directory that matches the domain name to the correct IP address of the server
                            hosting the website or providing the requested service. A domain can have an email address
                            associated with it.
                            <br><br>
                            The DNS system consists of a hierarchy of servers distributed worldwide. These servers
                            work together to resolve domain names into IP addresses. When you enter a domain name, your
                            computer first contacts a local DNS resolver (typically provided by your internet service
                            provider). If the local resolver doesn't have the IP address in its cache, it queries other
                            DNS servers in a recursive manner until it finds the correct IP address. The IP address is
                            then returned to your computer, allowing it to establish a connection with the desired
                            website or service.

                            domain name system (DNS). It is the part of a domain name that appears to the right of the

                        <br><span>The DNS servers are organized in a hierarchical manner, forming a network of
                            interconnected servers. At the top of the hierarchy are the root DNS servers. These servers
                            store information about the top-level domains (TLDs) such as .com, .org, .net, and the
                            country-code TLDs like .uk, .fr, etc. Beneath the root servers are the authoritative DNS
                            servers responsible for specific domain names or zones.
                            <br><br>
                            When a DNS resolver receives a query for a domain name, it starts by contacting one of the
                            root DNS servers. The root server doesn't have detailed information about the requested
                            domain but can direct the resolver to the appropriate TLD server. The TLD server, in turn,
                            provides the resolver with the address of the authoritative DNS server responsible for the
                            specific domain.
                            <br><br>
                            The authoritative DNS server holds the actual DNS records for the domain, including the IP
                            address associated with the domain name. The resolver can then contact the authoritative DNS
                            server to obtain the IP address and return it to the requesting client.
                            <br><br>
                            Once the client receives the IP address, it can establish a direct connection with the
                            server hosting the desired website or service. The client uses the obtained IP address to
                            send network packets to the server, requesting the specific content or service associated
                            with the domain name.
                            <br><br>
                            The client's operating system or application typically handles the connection establishment
                            process. It opens a network connection to the IP address received and communicates with the
                            server using the appropriate network protocols (such as HTTP for websites). The server, in
                            turn, responds to the client's requests and provides the requested content or service over
                            the established connection.</span>

                                        is manually assigned to a device and remains constant. It doesn't change unless
                                        it is reconfigured manually. Static IP addresses are often used for devices that
                                        require consistent and predictable connectivity, such as servers or network
                                        equipment.</span></li>

                                        (DHCP) server. When your device connects to the network, the DHCP server
                                        dynamically assigns an available IP address from a pool of addresses. This is
                                        the most common type of IP address assignment for residential users and small

                            <span>IP addresses are typically represented as a series of four numbers separated by periods,
                            such as "192.168.0.1". Each number can range from 0 to 255, allowing for a total of
                            approximately 4.3 billion unique IP addresses in the most common format, IPv4.</span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span>Because of the growth of the internet, IPv6 was introduced. IPv6 uses a different addressing
                            scheme, employing 128 bits instead of 32 bits used in IPv4, allowing for a significantly
                            larger number of unique addresses.</span>
                            <br><br>
                            <span>In some cases, multiple devices within a private network may share a single public IP
                            address using a technique called Network Address Translation (NAT). This allows multiple
                            devices to connect to the internet using a single IP address assigned to the network's
                            router. The router translates the internal IP addresses of the devices into the public IP
                            address when communicating with the internet.</span>

                            <span>In the example IP address "192.168.0.1", each unit represents a specific part of the
                            address. IP addresses are typically written in a format called dotted-decimal notation,
                            where the address is divided into four segments or octets, separated by periods. Each octet
                            is represented by a number ranging from 0 to 255.</span>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The first octet, "192," represents the network address or network ID.</li>
                                <li>The second octet, "168," represents the subnet address.</li>
                                <li>The third octet, "0," represents the subnet address or host ID.</li>
                                <li>The fourth octet, "1," represents the host address.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <span>The first three octets (192.168.0) typically denote a private IP address range used within a
                            local network, while the last octet (1) represents a specific device within that network. IP
                            address structures can vary depending on the network configuration, and different ranges of
                            IP addresses may serve different purposes or belong to different network classes.</span>

                            mask is a 32-bit number used in IP (Internet Protocol) networking to divide an IP address
                            into two parts: the network address and the host address. It is used to determine which part
                            of the IP address represents the network and which part represents the host.
                            <br><br>
                            The subnet mask consists of a series of ones (1) followed by a series of zeros (0). The ones
                            represent the network portion of the IP address, and the zeros represent the host portion.
                            The length of the ones in the subnet mask determines the size of the network.
                            <br><br>
                            For example, a common subnet mask used in IPv4 is 255.255.255.0. In binary, this is

                            are ones, indicating the network portion, and the last octet (8 bits) is all zeros,
                            representing the host portion. This subnet mask is used to create a network with 24 bits for
                            the network address and 8 bits for the host address, allowing for up to 254 hosts in the
                            network.

                            Subnet masks can vary depending on the size of the network required. They can be expressed
                            in dotted decimal notation, as shown above, or in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
                            notation, which uses a slash followed by the number of ones in the subnet mask. For example,
                            the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 can also be expressed as /24 in CIDR notation.

                            With the advent of IPv6, which uses a different addressing scheme, subnet masks are less
                            commonly used. Instead, IPv6 typically uses prefix lengths to denote the network portion.

                            subnet, short
                            for subnetwork, refers to a logical subdivision of an IP network. It involves dividing a
                            larger network into smaller, more manageable parts called subnets.
                            <br><br>
                            Subnetting is commonly used to improve network performance, security, and organization. By
                            dividing a network into smaller subnets, it allows for more efficient allocation of IP
                            addresses and reduces network congestion. Subnetting also enables network administrators to
                            implement security measures, such as firewall rules or access controls, at the subnet level,
                            providing an additional layer of protection.

                            In this example, all devices with IP addresses in the range of 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254
                            belong to the same subnet.

                            Address Translation (NAT) is a technique used in computer networks to map an IP address or a
                            range of IP addresses to another IP address or a different range of IP addresses. It is
                            primarily employed in internet routing to conserve the limited pool of available IP
                            addresses.
                            <br><br>
                            The main purpose of NAT is to allow multiple devices on a private network, typically within
                            a local area network (LAN), to share a single public IP address when communicating with
                            devices on the internet. This is achieved by translating the private IP addresses of the
                            devices within the LAN to the public IP address assigned to the router or gateway connecting
                            the LAN to the internet.
                            <br><br>
                            There are different types of NAT, including:

                                <li class="explanation">Static NAT: <span>It is a one-to-one mapping that is established
                                        between a private IP address and a public IP address. This mapping is typically
                                        configured manually by a network administrator or through network configuration
                                        settings.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Static NAT is often used when there is a need for inbound access to specific
                                        devices on a private network. For example, a web server or an email server
                                        within an internal network can be assigned a static NAT mapping so that it can
                                        be accessed from the internet using a consistent public IP address.

                                <li class="explanation">Dynamic NAT: <span>It is a type of NAT where private IP
                                        addresses are dynamically translated to public IP addresses from a pool of
                                        available addresses. It allows multiple devices within a private network to
                                        share a limited number of public IP addresses.
                                        <br><br>
                                        In dynamic NAT, the translation between private and public IP addresses occurs
                                        on a per-session basis. When a device from the private network initiates a
                                        connection to a device on the internet, the NAT device assigns an available
                                        public IP address from its pool and creates a temporary mapping for that
                                        session. Address reuse: When a session is terminated, the public IP address that
                                        was assigned to that session is released back to the pool and can be reused for
                                        subsequent sessions.
