                                The server renders the code and then responds back to the client with the generated web
                                pages. It does it by taking the stored content, applying templates, themes, and other
                                relevant components, and dynamically rendering the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that
                                make up the web page. Some Content Delivery Applications may use server-side rendering
                                (SSR), while others may utilize client-side rendering (CSR) or a combination of both
                                (e.g., hybrid rendering).

                    <li><span class="heading explanation-title A" id="Domain-Name-System">DNS (Domain Name System):
                        </span> It is a distributed (interconnected DNS servers) naming system used to translate
                        human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
                        <br><br>
                        When you type a domain name, such as "www.example.com", into your web browser, the DNS system is
                        responsible for finding the corresponding IP address associated with that domain. It acts as a
                        directory that matches the domain name to the correct IP address of the server hosting the
                        website or providing the requested service. A domain can have an email address associated with
                        it.
                        <br><br>
                        The DNS system consists of a hierarchy of servers distributed worldwide. These servers work
                        together to resolve domain names into IP addresses. When you enter a domain name, your computer
                        first contacts a local DNS resolver (typically provided by your internet service provider). If
                        the local resolver doesn't have the IP address in its cache, it queries other DNS servers in a
                        recursive manner until it finds the correct IP address. The IP address is then returned to your
                        computer, allowing it to establish a connection with the desired website or service.

                            Domain:</span> A top-level domain (TLD) is the highest level in the hierarchical domain name
                        system (DNS). It is the part of a domain name that appears to the right of the final dot, such
                        as ".com," ".org," or ".net.". TLDs are used to categorize and classify websites.
                        <br><br>
                        There are two main types of TLDs:

                        <br>
                        The DNS servers are organized in a hierarchical manner, forming a network of interconnected
                        servers. At the top of the hierarchy are the root DNS servers. These servers store information
                        about the top-level domains (TLDs) such as .com, .org, .net, and the country-code TLDs like .uk,
                        .fr, etc. Beneath the root servers are the authoritative DNS servers responsible for specific
                        domain names or zones.
                        <br><br> When a DNS resolver receives a query for a domain name, it starts by contacting one of
                        the root DNS servers. The root server doesn't have detailed information about the requested
                        domain but can direct the resolver to the appropriate TLD server. The TLD server, in turn,
                        provides the resolver with the address of the authoritative DNS server responsible for the
                        specific domain.
                        <br><br>
                        The authoritative DNS server holds the actual DNS records for the domain, including the IP
                        address associated with the domain name. The resolver can then contact the authoritative DNS
                        server to obtain the IP address and return it to the requesting client.
                        <br><br>
                        Once the client receives the IP address, it can establish a direct connection with the server
                        hosting the desired website or service. The client uses the obtained IP address to send network
                        packets to the server, requesting the specific content or service associated with the domain
                        name.
                        <br><br>
                        The client's operating system or application typically handles the connection establishment
                        process. It opens a network connection to the IP address received and communicates with the
                        server using the appropriate network protocols (such as HTTP for websites). The server, in turn,
                        responds to the client's requests and provides the requested content or service over the
                        established connection.

                        main purposes: identifying the host or network interface (hardware or software component that
                        allows a device to connect to a computer network) and providing the location of the device in
                        the network.
                        <br><br>
                        There are two types of IP addresses: static IP addresses and dynamic IP addresses.

                                constant. It doesn't change unless it is reconfigured manually. Static IP addresses are
                                often used for devices that require consistent and predictable connectivity, such as
                                servers or network equipment.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><span class="heading explanation-subtitle AB" id="Dynamic-IP-Address">Dynamic IP
                                    Address:</span> A dynamic IP address is assigned automatically by a Dynamic Host
                                Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. When your device connects to the network, the DHCP
                                server dynamically assigns an available IP address from a pool of addresses. This is the
                                most common type of IP address assignment for residential users and small businesses.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        IP addresses are typically represented as a series of four numbers separated by periods, such as
                        "192.168.0.1". Each number can range from 0 to 255, allowing for a total of approximately 4.3
                        billion unique IP addresses in the most common format, IPv4.
                        <br><br>
                        Because of the growth of the internet, IPv6 was introduced. IPv6 uses a different addressing
                        scheme, employing 128 bits instead of 32 bits used in IPv4, allowing for a significantly larger
                        number of unique addresses.
                        <br><br>
                        In some cases, multiple devices within a private network (LAN) may share a single public IP
                        address
                        using a technique called Network Address Translation (NAT). This allows multiple devices to
                        connect to the internet using a single IP address assigned to the network's router. The router
                        translates the internal IP addresses of the devices into the public IP address when
                        communicating with the internet.
                        <br><br>
                        In the example IP address "192.168.0.1", each unit represents a specific part of the address. IP
                        addresses are typically written in a format called dotted-decimal notation, where the address is
                        divided into four segments or octets, separated by periods. Each octet is represented by a
                        number ranging from 0 to 255.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first octet, "192," represents the network address or network ID.</li>
                            <li>The second octet, "168," represents the subnet address.</li>
                            <li>The third octet, "0," represents the subnet address or host ID.</li>
                            <li>The fourth octet, "1," represents the host address.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        The first three octets (192.168.0) typically denote a private IP address range used within a
                        local network, while the last octet (1) represents a specific device within that network. IP
                        address structures can vary depending on the network configuration, and different ranges of IP
                        addresses may serve different purposes or belong to different network classes.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><span class="heading explanation-title A" id="Subnet">Subnet:</span> A subnet,
                        short for subnetwork, refers to a logical subdivision of an IP network. It involves dividing a
                        larger network into smaller, more manageable parts called subnets.
                        <br><br>
                        Subnetting is commonly used to improve network performance, security, and organization. By
                        dividing a network into smaller subnets, it allows for more efficient allocation of IP addresses
                        and reduces network congestion. Subnetting also enables network administrators to implement
                        security measures, such as firewall rules or access controls, at the subnet level, providing an
                        additional layer of protection.
                        <br><br>
                        In this example, all devices with IP addresses in the range of 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254
                        belong to the same subnet.
                    </li>

                    <li><span class="heading explanation-title A" id="Subnet-Mask">Subnet Mask:
                        </span> A subnet mask is a 32-bit number used in IP (Internet Protocol) networking to divide an
                        IP address into two parts: the network address and the host address. It is used to determine
                        which part of the IP address represents the network and which part represents the host.
                        <br><br>
                        The subnet mask consists of a series of ones (1) followed by a series of zeros (0). The ones
                        represent the network portion of the IP address, and the zeros represent the host portion. The
                        length of the ones in the subnet mask determines the size of the network.
                        <br><br>
                        For example, a common subnet mask used in IPv4 is <span class="highlight">255.255.255.0</span>.
                        In binary, this is represented as <span

                        (24 bits) are ones, indicating the network portion, and the last octet (8 bits) is all zeros,
                        representing the host portion. This subnet mask is used to create a network with 24 bits for the
                        network address and 8 bits for the host address, allowing for up to 254 hosts in the network.

                        Subnet masks can vary depending on the size of the network required. They can be expressed in
                        dotted decimal notation, as shown above, or in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation,
                        which uses a slash followed by the number of ones in the subnet mask. For example, the subnet
                        mask 255.255.255.0 can also be expressed as /24 in CIDR notation (255.255.255.0/24).

                        With the advent of IPv6, which uses a different addressing scheme, subnet masks are less
                        commonly used. Instead, IPv6 typically uses prefix lengths to denote the network portion.

                            Translation (NAT):</span> Network Address
                        Translation (NAT) is a technique used in computer networks to map an IP address or a range of IP
                        addresses to another IP address or a different range of IP addresses. It is primarily employed
                        in internet routing to conserve the limited pool of available IP addresses.
                        <br><br>
                        The main purpose of NAT is to allow multiple devices on a private network, typically within a
                        local area network (LAN), to share a single public IP address when communicating with devices on
                        the internet. This is achieved by translating the private IP addresses of the devices within the
                        LAN to the public IP address assigned to the router or gateway connecting the LAN to the
                        internet.
                        <br><br>
                        There are different types of NAT, including:
                        <ol>

                                    id="Static-Network-Address-Translation">Static NAT:</span> It is a one-to-one
                                mapping that is established between a private IP address and a public IP address. This
                                mapping is typically configured manually by a network administrator or through network
                                configuration settings.
                                <br><br>
                                Static NAT is often used when there is a need for inbound access to specific devices on
                                a private network. For example, a web server or an email server within an internal
                                network can be assigned a static NAT mapping so that it can be accessed from the
                                internet using a consistent public IP address.

                                    id="Dynamic-Network-Address-Translation">Dynamic NAT:</span> It is a type of NAT
                                where private IP addresses are dynamically translated to public IP addresses from a pool
                                of available addresses. It allows multiple devices within a private network to share a
                                limited number of public IP addresses.
                                <br><br>
                                In dynamic NAT, the translation between private and public IP addresses occurs on a
                                per-session basis. When a device from the private network initiates a connection to a
                                device on the internet, the NAT device assigns an available public IP address from its
                                pool and creates a temporary mapping for that session. Address reuse: When a session is
                                terminated, the public IP address that was assigned to that session is released back to
                                the pool and can be reused for subsequent sessions.

                                    id="Dynamic-Port-Address-Translation">Dynamic Port Address Translation (PAT):</span>
                                also known as Port Address Translation or Overload NAT. It allows multiple devices on a
                                private network to share a single public IP address while using different port numbers
                                to distinguish between their connections.
                                <br><br>
                                When a device on the private network sends data to the internet, the router modifies the
                                source IP address and port number of the outgoing packets to the public IP address and a
                                unique port number. When the responses come back from the internet, the router uses the
                                port number to correctly route the incoming packets back to the appropriate device on
                                the private network.
                                <br><br>
                                PAT allows for a much larger number of devices to share a single public IP address
                                compared to other forms of NAT. PAT is commonly used in residential and small
                                office/home office (SOHO - Small Office/Home Office) environments where there are more
                                devices than available
                                public IP addresses. It allows multiple devices to access the internet simultaneously.

                            Network):</span>
                        It refers to a computer network that covers a small geographic area, typically within a single
                        building or a group of nearby buildings.
                        <br><br>
                        The primary purpose of a LAN is to enable the sharing of resources and information among devices
                        within the network. This can include computers, printers, servers, storage devices, and other
                        networked devices.
                        <br><br>
                        LANs are characterized by their high data transfer rates, low latency, and relatively short
                        transmission distances. They typically use Ethernet or Wi-Fi as the underlying technology for
                        data transmission.
                        <br><br>
                        LANs are often privately owned and operated, allowing organizations or individuals to have full
                        control over their network infrastructure and security. LANs can also be connected to wider
                        networks, such as wide area networks (WANs) or the internet, to enable access to external
                        resources.

                    <li><span class="heading explanation-title A" id="Wide-Area-Network">WAN (Wide Area Network):</span>
                        It refers to a computer network that spans a large geographic area, typically connecting
                        multiple LANs or other networks together. WANs are designed to facilitate communication and data
                        transfer over long distances, often using public or private telecommunication infrastructure.
                        <br><br>
                        Unlike a LAN, which covers a small area like a building or campus, a WAN can cover a city, a
                        country, or even span across continents. WANs are commonly used by organizations with multiple
                        branch offices located in different geographical locations to establish connectivity and enable
                        centralized communication and resource sharing.
                        <br><br>
                        WANs utilize various technologies to transmit data over long distances, including leased lines,
                        fiber optic cables, satellite links, microwave links, and internet connections. The internet
                        itself can be seen as the largest example of a WAN, connecting millions of devices and networks
                        across the globe.
                        <br><br>
                        Some common applications of WANs include interconnecting branch offices, data sharing between
                        different sites, video conferencing, remote access to centralized resources, cloud computing,
                        and accessing the internet.
